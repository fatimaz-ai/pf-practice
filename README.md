# C++ Practice ( Programming Fundamentals)

This repository contains my daily C++ practice code while learning programming fundamentals  
I'm focusing on topics like input/output, conditions, loops, functions, and arrays.

 Structure:
day01:hello_world.cpp
day02:variables.cpp
day03:if_else.cpp
 ...

I'll keep updating this as I learn more!
